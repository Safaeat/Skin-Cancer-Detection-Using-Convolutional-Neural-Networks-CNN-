# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNN-
Developed a deep learning–based skin cancer detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify dermoscopic images as benign or malignant. The project covers end-to-end pipeline design, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and real-time image prediction.
